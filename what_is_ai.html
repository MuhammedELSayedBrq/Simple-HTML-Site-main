    <p>
        Artificial intelligence has become a comprehensive term for applications that perform complex tasks that in the
        past required human inputs such as communicating with customers over the Internet or playing chess. The term is
        often used interchangeably with its sub-fields, which include machine learning and deep learning. However, there
        are differences. For example, machine learning focuses on creating systems that learn or improve their
        performance based on the data they consume. It is important to note that although all avenues of machine
        learning are only artificial intelligence, not all artificial intelligence is machine learning.

        In the simplest terms, the term artificial intelligence (AI) refers to systems or devices that mimic human
        intelligence to perform tasks that can improve themselves based on the information they collect. Artificial
        intelligence manifests itself in a number of forms. Some of these examples are:
        Conversation robots use artificial intelligence to understand customer problems faster and provide more
        efficient answers.
        AI-based operators use it to analyze critical information from a wide range of text data to improve scheduling.
