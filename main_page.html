    <h2>About artificial intelligence?</h2>
    <img src="artificial-brain.webp" alt="AI image" width="400px" height="200px">
    <p>According to the father of Artificial Intelligence, John McCarthy, it is "The science and engineering of making
      intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs".</p>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence is a way of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or software think
      intelligently, in a similar manner to how intelligent humans think.</p>
    <p>AI is accomplished by studying how the human brain thinks, how humans learn, decide, and work while trying to
      solve a problem, and then using the outcomes of this study as a basis for developing intelligent software and
      systems.</p>
