    <p>Artificial intelligence provides value for most jobs, businesses, and fields. It includes general applications
        and applications for specific fields, such as:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Using transaction data and demographic data to predict the extent of spending of specific customers on the
            extent of their relationship with the company (or the customer's permanent value)
        </li>

        <li>Improve prices based on customer behavior and preferences</li>

        <li>
            Use the image recognition feature to analyze X-ray images of cancer signs Artificial intelligence
            capabilities
        </li>

        <li>
            Artificial intelligence acquires information through practical practices, and it is able to accurately
            distinguish between multiple issues.
            One of the most important capabilities of artificial intelligence is its response to changes, and it is
            characterized by flexibility and speed of reaction in all situations.
            Artificial intelligence has its ability to perceive, and thus make decisions properly, depending on studying
            all the possibilities and mastering its results, and then choosing the best decisions that lead to the
            desired results.

        </li>

        <li>
            Be able to quickly detect and correct errors, and make better improvements in the future.
        </li>

        <li>
            It can be said that artificial intelligence started with the development of some different computer
            programs, chief among them chess games, when the scientist Claude Shannon drew up an algorithm that
            qualified the computer to play chess and expected all the possibilities of the other player to move.

    </ol>
