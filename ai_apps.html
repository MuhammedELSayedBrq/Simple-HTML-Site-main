    <p>There are many practical applications of artificial intelligence, and the most prominent of these applications
        are the following:</p>
    </center>

    <ul>
        <li>Games:
            Artificial intelligence systems are used in many electronic games; That requires a dimension and strategic
            thinking, such as poker and chess, for example.</li>

        <li>Interacting with the visual system:
            Some applications of artificial intelligence can interpret and analyze the images entered into them. Such as
            facial recognition software, image analysis for positioning, and other similar applications.</li>

        <li>Interacting with handwriting:
            This is through applications for recognizing handwriting, whether it is writing on paper or on the screen of
            the device itself. Intelligent robots: Robots do a lot of different actions, as they can do the work that
            humans do, because of their ability to feel the surrounding factors such as light, heat, sound, or movement,
            through special sensors, and these robots are able to learn from</li>
